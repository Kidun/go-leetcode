## 344.Reverse String

[https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

*Easy*

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with `O(1)` extra memory.

**Example 1:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
<strong>Output:</strong> ["o","l","l","e","h"]
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
<strong>Output:</strong> ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
* `s[i]` is a[printable ascii character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).
