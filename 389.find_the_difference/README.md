## 389. Find the Difference

[https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

*Easy*

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

**Example 1:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
<strong>Output:</strong> "e"
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 'e' is the letter that was added.
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "", t = "y"
<strong>Output:</strong> "y"
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `t.length == s.length + 1`
* `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters
